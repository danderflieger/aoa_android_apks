# AoA Android APKs
This is a repository for pre-built Android installation files (commonly known as APK files). In this case, this is where the Angle of Attack Indicator APK files will live.

To install a pre-built APK file:
- download the APK file to your Android device and take note of where it is saved (hint: it's likely in your *Downloads* directory)
- browse to that location using a file browser app (I don't think I've never seen an Android device without one pre-installed)
- tap on the APK file. Note: you will likely be prompted to give permission to install it. If you feel comfortable doing so - go for it. If not, you'll need to either install Android Studio and compile it yourself or write your own app.
